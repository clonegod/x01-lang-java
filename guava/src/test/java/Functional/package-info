Specifically, we will be covering the following topics in this chapter:

• The Function interface: This explains how we can introduce functional
programming to our Java programs. It also explains how best we can use
the Function interface and recognize where its usage is not appropriate

• The Functions class: This class is a collection of static methods that are
used to work with implementations of the Function interface

• The Predicate interface: This is an interface that evaluates a given object
for certain criteria and returns true if the object has met the criteria

• The Predicates class: This is a companion class to the Predicate
interface that has static utility methods for working with implementations
of the Predicate interface

• The Supplier interface: This is an interface used to supply an object of
a given type. We will see how to use the Supplier interface to implement
a variety of patterns to create objects

• The Suppliers class: This is a class that provides some default
implementations of the Supplier interface
